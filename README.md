## Overview

This repository provides a powerful tool for stock market prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. It fetches historical stock data from the Twelve Data API, forecasts future prices, and visualizes trends and confidence bands. The project also offers AI-based market suggestions to assist users in making informed investment decisions.

## Features

- **Data Fetching**: Automatically retrieves historical stock data from the Twelve Data API.
- **Price Forecasting**: Uses LSTM models to predict future stock prices.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays trends, confidence bands, and predictions using charts.
- **Market Suggestions**: Provides AI-driven recommendations based on the predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning**: LSTM models for time-series analysis.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API for building and training models.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend engine for running the LSTM model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Data analysis and manipulation library.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive web applications.
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Techniques for analyzing time-ordered data points.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NoUniqueName/LSTM-based-Stock-market-Prediction.git
   cd LSTM-based-Stock-market-Prediction
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
